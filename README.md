# BookPOI -- Literary Places & Notes

## Short Description

Discover real-world locations from your favorite books. Create map-based
notes and explore literature around you.

**BookPOI connects the stories you love with real places.** Create
personal, map-based points of interest (POIs) linked to books, scenes,

When traveling, BookPOI can notify you when you're near one of your
saved literary spots.
